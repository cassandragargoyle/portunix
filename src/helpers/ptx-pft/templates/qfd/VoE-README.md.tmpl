# Voice of Engineering (VoE)

## Purpose

Evidence of technical capabilities, constraints, dependencies, and best practices
from the development team's perspective.

## VoE Sources

- Architecture documentation
- Technical debt (backlog)
- External system dependencies
- Capacity constraints
- Security requirements
- Standards and best practices

## Structure

### verbatims/
Technical inputs, developer opinions, architectural decisions.

### needs/
Technical needs and infrastructure requirements.

### constraints/
Technical constraints and dependencies affecting possible solutions.
