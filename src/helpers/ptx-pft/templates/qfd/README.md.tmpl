# {{.ProjectName}}

## Overview

This project uses QFD (Quality Function Deployment) methodology per ISO 16355
for systematic requirements management from voice of customer collection
through technical specification.

## Project Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| VoC/ | Voice of Customer - customer needs |
| VoB/ | Voice of Business - business goals and constraints |
| VoE/ | Voice of Engineering - technical capabilities and constraints |
| VoS/ | Voice of Stakeholder - regulations, partners, internal stakeholders |
| requirements/ | Technical requirements (intersection of all Voices) |
| matrices/ | QFD matrices and prioritization |

## Naming Conventions

### File Prefixes

| Voice | Verbatim | Need |
|-------|----------|------|
| VoC | VC-V001 | VC-P01, VC-S01, VC-T01 |
| VoB | VB-V001 | VB-P01, VB-S01, VB-T01 |
| VoE | VE-V001 | VE-C01 (constraints) |
| VoS | VS-V001 | VS-P01, VS-S01, VS-T01 |
| Requirements | - | R001, R002, ... |

### Need Levels (ISO 16355)

| Level | Prefix | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Primary | P | Strategic need (highest abstraction) |
| Secondary | S | Tactical need |
| Tertiary | T | Specific, measurable need |

### Maturity Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Captured | Raw input recorded |
| Structured | Placed in hierarchy |
| Analyzed | Context and motivation understood |
| Prioritized | Importance determined (AHP, Kano) |
| Translated | Converted to technical requirement |
| Deployed | Handed off to implementation |

### Kano Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Must-be | Basic requirement (non-fulfillment = dissatisfaction) |
| Performance | Linear relationship between fulfillment and satisfaction |
| Delighter | Surprise (unexpected value) |

## Workflow

```
Verbatim -> Reworded Need -> Customer Requirement -> Quality Characteristic -> Technical Requirement
```

1. **Acquisition** - Capture verbatim into `VoX/verbatims/`
2. **Structuring** - Create need in `VoX/needs/` linked to verbatim
3. **Analysis** - Add context, Kano category
4. **Prioritization** - AHP score, update `matrices/`
5. **Translation** - Create technical requirement in `requirements/`

## Tools

- **Editor:** MarkText / Obsidian / VS Code with Markdown preview
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Wikilinks:** `[[VC-V001]]` for inter-file navigation
