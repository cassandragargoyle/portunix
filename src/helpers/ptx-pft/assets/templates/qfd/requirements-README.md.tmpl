# Technical Requirements

## Purpose

Evidence of technical requirements derived from all Voices' needs. Each requirement
must be linked to at least one need.

## Workflow

```
VoC/VoB/VoE/VoS Needs -> Translation -> Technical Requirement -> Implementation
```

## Template: Requirement

File: `R001-name.md`

```markdown
# R001 - [Requirement Name]

## Metadata
- **Status:** [Draft / Ready / In Progress / Done / Cancelled]
- **Priority:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
- **Effort:** [XS / S / M / L / XL]
- **Sprint/Release:** [reference]

## Description
[Technical requirement description]

## Addresses Needs
- [[VC-S01-name]] (VoC)
- [[VB-P01-name]] (VoB)

## Constraints
- [[VE-C01-name]]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

## Technical Notes
[Solution design, architecture, dependencies]

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** [[R002-name]]
- **Depends on:** [[R003-name]]
```

## Rules

1. Every requirement must link to at least one Need
2. Requirement without linkage = candidate for removal
3. Priority is derived from AHP scores of linked Needs
4. "Ready" status requires defined acceptance criteria
