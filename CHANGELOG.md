## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-17

### Added in 2.2.2

- **Odoo installation support** (Issue #172) — installable via `portunix install odoo`; container sidecar orchestration with external PostgreSQL variant (`container-external-db`) and `--db-*` install flags
- **Container network/volume/inspect subcommands** (Issue #173) — first-class `portunix container network`, `portunix container volume`, and `portunix container inspect` commands unifying Docker/Podman inspection flows
- **uv Python tooling adoption** (Issue #171, ADR-039) — `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` replace `requirements.txt` / `test/requirements-test.txt`; `scripts/setup-venv.*` rewritten to call `uv sync`; standalone `scripts/*.py` gain PEP 723 inline metadata so they run via `uv run script.py` on any machine with uv installed; `portunix install uv` package added to ptx-installer
- **Node.js + markdownlint-cli2 in dev-setup** (Issue #170) — `scripts/dev-setup.sh` / `dev-setup.ps1` now bootstrap Node.js and `markdownlint-cli2`, enabling `make lint-md` on fresh clones
- **Czech README translations** — `README.cs.md` (Gitea) and `README.github.cs.md` (GitHub); dual-README rename in the GitHub sync script generalized to handle language suffixes (`README.github[.<lang>].md` → `README[.<lang>].md`)
- **scripts/README.md** — index of all scripts with a clean separation between one-time GitHub onboarding (`github-00-setup.sh`, `github-02-quick-publish.sh`) and recurring sync (`github-01-preflight-check.sh`, `github-02-sync-publish.py`)

### Changed in 2.2.2

- **Portunix tagline** — repositioned as "unified AI plugin and task platform for development environments" across README.md, README.github.md, CLAUDE.md, docs-site, and release scripts
- **GitHub sync workflow** — `scripts/github-02-sync-publish.py` no longer registers a `github` remote on the Gitea development repo; it clones GitHub by URL directly into the work directory, keeping the two repositories cleanly separated
- **Command handling documentation** — expanded and clarified across multiple helpers (ptx-aiops, ptx-ansible, ptx-container, ptx-credential, ptx-make, ptx-mcp, ptx-pft, ptx-prompting, ptx-python, ptx-trace, ptx-virt)

### Fixed in 2.2.2

- **hugo.json package definition** (Issue #170) — removed trailing commas that broke JSON parsing on strict parsers
- **Odoo acceptance defects** (Issue #172) — resolved install defects uncovered during container-based acceptance testing; addressed Findings #4/#5/#6 in `odoo.json` descriptions

### Removed in 2.2.2

- **`scripts/activate-venv.{sh,ps1,cmd}`** — with `uv run <cmd>` replacing activation for scripts, pytest, and REPLs, and modern IDEs auto-detecting `.venv/` via `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, the wrappers no longer earn their keep (ADR-039)
- **Legacy `requirements.txt` and `test/requirements-test.txt`** — superseded by `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed in 2.2.1

- **Windows build failure** (Issue #169) — service package used Linux-only syscalls (`Setpgid`, `Flock`) without build constraints; split into platform-specific files with proper Windows equivalents (`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, `LockFileEx`)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added in 2.2.0

- **Proxmox VM/CT management** — automated provisioning commands for Proxmox virtualization

### Fixed in 2.2.0

- **setx PATH bug** — replaced broken `setx PATH "%PATH%;..."` with `environment.PATH_APPEND` in 9 packages (ninja, hugo, hugo-extended, actionlint, act, caddy, clang, protoc, tea)
- **Windows install.ps1** — rewritten as standalone installer (Issue #164)
