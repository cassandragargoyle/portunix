# Docker Installation Issues on Windows

## Issue Summary
Docker installation on Windows has several critical bugs affecting user experience and functionality.

## Problem
1. Incorrect disk detection (suggests non-existent D:\ drive)
2. Wrong configuration path (ignores user selection)
3. Installation verification failures
4. Inconsistent command behavior
5. PATH configuration issues

## Impact
Users on Windows cannot properly install Docker Desktop through Portunix, requiring manual intervention.

## Status
ðŸ”§ **In Progress** - Fix in development for v1.5.4

## Workaround
Until fixed, Windows users should:
1. Install Docker Desktop manually from docker.com
2. Configure daemon.json manually if needed
3. Add Docker to PATH manually
