# Contributing Documentation

This directory contains guidelines and documentation for contributing to the CassandraGargoyle bootstrap-scripts project.

## Multilingual Team Communication

### Official Project Language
- **English** is the primary language for all project communication
- Code, comments, documentation, and commit messages must be in English
- Use simple, clear English to accommodate non-native speakers
- Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, and culture-specific references

### Communication Best Practices
- Use AI-powered translation tools (DeepL, Google Translate) when needed
- Leverage asynchronous communication to accommodate different time zones
- Foster open communication with regular check-ins for clarification
- Be patient and respectful of language barriers and cultural differences

### Documentation Standards
- All technical documentation in English
- Use clear, concise language with simple sentence structures
- Provide examples and visual aids when possible
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the project

## Team Initials Assignment and Collision Resolution

Team members are assigned unique initials for identification purposes. When multiple members have the same initials (e.g., John Smith = JS), collision resolution is applied by adding additional characters from the surname (e.g., John Smith = JSm if JS is already taken).
